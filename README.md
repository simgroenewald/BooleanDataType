# BooleanDataType
Software Engineering Boot Camp - Task 8

Compulsory Task
One of the most important patterns in computers and on the internet is
your password. For a password to be classified as ”Strong” the password
needs to be structured in a certain way.
Password Strength is determined by:
○ The length of the password (at least 6 characters) (haveLength)
○ Needs to contain uppercase letters (upCase)
○ Needs to contain lowercase letters (lowCase)
○ Needs to contain numbers (haveNum)
● Declare boolean variables for each one of these characteristics.
● You will find the name of the variable next to the condition in the
list above. Each variable must be initialised as false.
● Then ask the user a series of yes or no questions for each variable,
change the boolean variable to True based on their answer.
● Once 3 of the characteristics are met (3 of the variables == True)
then display a message saying this is a suitable password.
